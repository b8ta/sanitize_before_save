Sanitize Before Save
====================

'Sanitize Before Save' is a Ruby on Rails plugin.
It Allows you to specify models that will always sanitize content before saving it to the database.


Example
=======

Just put the following line ('sanitize_before_save') in your model : 

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  sanitize_before_save
end

and automaticaly all your model data stored in database as a String value will be sanitized before they will be saved (or updated).

@person = Person.create(:name => %(Mathieu Fosse<script type="text/javascript">alert('Hello !');</script>))
@person.name == "Mathieu Fosse"


Optionnaly you can add an except option to disabled sanitize process in some fields like that :

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  sanitize_before_save :except => :name
end

With this option, all Person model fields will be sanitized before they will be saved except for 'name' field.
